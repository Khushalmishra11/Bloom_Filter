# Bloom Filter Web App

## Overview
The Bloom Filter Web App is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate a space-efficient probabilistic data structure known as a Bloom Filter. It operates with a low false positive rate of just 1%, making it ideal for applications that prioritize memory efficiency.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## Features
- **Optimized Performance**: Utilizes FNV-1a hashing and mathematical parameter tuning to enhance performance.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Achieves 98% memory savings compared to traditional hash tables, allowing storage of up to 10,000 items in just 9.6KB.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an engaging user interface for real-time demonstration of the Bloom Filter's functionality.
- **REST API**: Implements a full-stack architecture, facilitating seamless communication between the client and server.

## Roles & Highlights
- **Software Engineering**: Focus on algorithms with O(1) operations and mathematical optimizations.
- **DevOps**: Highlights effective deployment strategies using Vercel configuration and module system solutions.
- **Data Analysis**: Emphasizes efficiency through significant memory savings and performance metrics.
